# We've detected you are running npm 8.15.0 which has peer dependency semantics
# which Storybook is incompatible with. In order to work with Storybook's package
# structure, you'll need to run `npm` with the `--legacy-peer-deps=true` flag. We
# can generate an `.npmrc` which will do that automatically. 

# More info: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/18298

# NOTE: This had to be done when executed `npx storybook init` to setup `storybook`

# If you don't want pnpm to fail on peer dependency issues, add
# "strict-peer-dependencies=false" to an .npmrc file at the root of your project.
